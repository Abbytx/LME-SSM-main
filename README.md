This code is for the paper: Temporally Consistent Segmentation of Main Coronary Artery in X-ray Coronary Angiography Sequences.
The experimental data consists of coronary angiography video sequences of the heart. The data example is presented as follows:

# Quick start (Train and Test)
We provide the code for our model here (`Model.py`), and training and testing codeï¼ˆ`main.py`). The specific model settings can be found in the article's documentation.
We have provided a sample of preprocessed fMRI participant data in the Data folder (randomly generated using Python). Please replace it with real data for the actual experiment.
Before training the model, please configure the dependencies in the `requirements.txt`. Setting and modifying experimental parameters in `config.yaml`.
You can run `main.py` to quickly train and test the program.
